Yes, it still has all the hits â€” the kung pao pastrami, the thrice cooked bacon â€”but chef/proprietor Danny Bowien and executive chef Angela Dimayuga have also added a raw bar, two generous family-style set menus, and showstoppers like duck baked in clay. And you can still get a lot of food without breaking the bank."

Having read much, I knew going into it that it was not going to be authentic Chinese. The place was edgy, had a punk rock throwback attitude, and generally delivered the desired atmosphere. Things went downhill from there though. The food was okay at best and the best qualities were easily overshadowed by what I believe to be poor decisions by the kitchen staff."

Every inch of the massive Lower East Side space smells intensely of pastrami and rye loaves. The sandwiches are massive, so they are best when shared. Order at the counter, and don't forget to tip your slicer â€” your sandwich will be better for it."

Seriously, a bunch of meat albeit you can sample beforehand on rye/white/wheat bread. Cheese extra. Pickles free, you can just ask them at the pickup counter. But seriously 20 bucks gone for an non-flavored half sandwich. And a line that is long, especially if you want seating. I'm down to just take a quick look where Sally and Harry sat and leave to the other delis all around NYC. Oh and they accept Samsung pay."

Came here for lunch on a random weekday afternoon and when we arrived, there was a line forming already. The space is a bit cramped. You'll get to know your neighbors soon enough. The pizza is just delightful and delicious. It's a ncie plus that you get to see them firing up the pizzas in the corner. The major issue with Roberta's is the trek out to the Williamsburg/Bushwick."

It has A LOT of hype in the New York food scene, and I question if it deserves all of it, but it's still a totally great spot to hit up when in the area!!"

        "comments": "Barbecue aficionados agree that Billy Durney is cooking up some of the best Texas-style barbecue in the city. Straightforward classics like smoked brisket and baby back ribs are always a strong choice, but there are also options like pork belly tacos and a lamb belly banh mi. The space is sprawling in a way that feels like the real deal, and Durney himself can usually be found working the room, and keeping a watchful eye on the smoking meats. It's counter service only, and there's often a line, but for the scene and certainly for the meat, it's easily worth the trip to Red Hook."

Their pork tacos are to die for, their different variety of ribs and lastly, their lamb is not gamey at all. Super wallet friendly for the amount they give you. I highly recommend this spot- after eating here, you can definitely walk over for Steve's key lime pies."

Headley and his crew turn seasonal vegetables into delectable salads and riffs on American comfort food favorites. The specials menu changes daily, and the rest of the menu is constantly evolving. You can get a lot of food to eat here for under $15 per person."

Ambiance is a bit industrial, good is definitely much more sophisticated than the look of the place! Ordered the superiority burger anda side of potato salad. The potato salad was very light and tasted clean ( less mayo, lots of dill and some cucumber) -- refreshing for a humid summer night! Sandwich was surprisingly delicious - it is very small ( funny allusion to a White Castle burger) but it packs a punch! Not only are there layers of flavors ( amazing sauces) but the party itself had a great texture Ahmed flavor-- well done and so wonderful! Will definitely stop by again for an overall amazing burger/sandwich. Staff was super nice and accommodating but not out of the way friendly."

Itâ€™s a great choice when youâ€™re craving a steak, a burger, or oysters, and the menu always includes plentiful seafood options as well as pastas. The Dutch is now an indelible part of the Soho landscape."

Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I'm sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea."

Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I've ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY."
